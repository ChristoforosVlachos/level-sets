Keyboard shortcuts:
===== PART A =====
? => Show keyboard shortcuts
0 => Switch to Part B
D => Visualize differential coordinates
- => Shrink
+ => Inflate
* => Smart inflate
Smart inflation performs 75% smoothing after inflating. It is advised that you increase the inflation coefficient.

Sliders:
S0 => shrinking coefficient
S1 => inflation coefficient

===== PART B =====
? => Show keyboard shortcuts
0 => Switch to Part A
; => Generate SDF and force field
C => Export SDF and force field
Z => Import SDF and force field
' => Display SDF and force field
P => Show sphere
X => Show axis aligned box
M => Show 2nd mesh
SPACE => Perform collision detection using only the meshes
SHIFT + SPACE => Perform collision detection using the SDF
E => Calculate collision response force
T => Show/Hide auxiliary triangles
L => Show/Hide auxiliary lines

Sliders:
S0 => probe point x coordinate
S1 => probe point y coordinate
S2 => probe point z coordinate
S3 => sphere/box/mesh2 size
S4 => SDF resolution (DON'T SET TOO LARGE)
